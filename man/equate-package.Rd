Observed-Score Linking and Equating
}
\description{
The equate package contains methods for observed-score linking and equating under the single-group, equivalent-groups, and nonequivalent-groups designs. Equating types include identity, mean, linear, general linear, equipercentile, circle-arc, and composites of these types. Equating methods include synthetic, nominal weights, Tucker, Levine observed score, Levine true score, Braun/Holland, frequency estimation, and chained equating. Plotting and summary methods, and methods for univariate and bivariate presmoothing are also provided.}
