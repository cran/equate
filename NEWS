    now a wrapper for 'glm'
    
  o new function plot.equate, for plotting and
    comparing equating results
    
  o equate and other functions modified to handle
    linking of forms with different score scales

    where marginal frequencies are zero 
  
  o Help files updated

    to another scale based on output from a 
    previous equating

  o Proportional weighting when estimating the
    synthetic distribution, using argument 'w'

  o Layout of freqtab function changed

  o Simple plotting method added for univariate
    and bivariate frequency tables

  o se.boot function returns matrix of bootstrap
    replications

  o Equipercentile equating updated to handle
    frequency tables missing substantial amounts
    of data

    frequency tables
